## Overview
This repository contains the R scripts and data necessary to replicate the findings of our longitudinal study on age-related heterogeneity in COVID-19 transmission across Belgium. This research is detailed in the preprint manuscript listed below, emphasizing different age groups' distinct roles during the pandemic.

## System & Software Requirements
- **R Version**: 4.3.0
- **RStudio Version**: 2023.12.0.369

These versions were used for the analysis, ensuring the reproducibility of the results. Please install these versions or later to avoid compatibility issues.

## Repository Contents

### Folders:
- `data`: Contains the data needed to reproduce the analysis.
- `fatigue_correction`: Includes estimated effects of fatigue when filling out CoMix social contact surveys [3.].
- `R`, `R_socialmix`: R scripts adapted from the SOCRATES project[1.] to handle Comix social contact data[2.].

### Scripts:
- `add_functions.R`: Defines necessary functions for the analysis.
- `helpers.R`: Contains the necessary functions to run supplementary analysis for the study.
- `preliminary.R`: Installs necessary packages and runs preliminary operations.
- `wave_specific_an.R`: Processes waves of the CoMix survey and generates variables required for the analysis.
- `long_analysis_BE.R`: Generates the results of the analysis.

## How to Use
To replicate the study results:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure R and RStudio are installed with the versions specified above.
3. Run `preliminary.R` to install required packages.
4. Execute `wave_specific_an.R` and `long_analysis_BE.R` sequentially to generate the results and plots as described in the manuscript.
5. If you are just interested in the final results, it is sufficient to run `long_analysis_BE.R`, which will automatically run all the dependencies.
6. Expected run time: 13 mins
